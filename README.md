## **Information**

* I've using **Prettier** as a default code formatter.
* I've using **ESlint** as a default linter in development process.
* I'm finish all end point expect search and channelSections api due to lack of time
* I can do unit testing using karma with angular but I have not tried it before using jest with vue but i know jest with javascript

## **Enhancements**

* Enhance the project & make the component more reusable..


## **Why I didn't finish the search and channelSections api ?**

* I couldn't get enough free time at work.
* i'm working full time and i'm working with Reactjs and angular framework not using vuejs before and 
  this is what made me waste some time to learn it
* Many companies have sent me their tasks while I am doing the work, most of them are beside my work.
